How to Break Save Encryption

Before viewing a save for any game, you must use this program to create a key file for that game. This allows you to break the encryption of the game's saves and view information about your Pokémon.

This setup only needs to be done once per game.

See "How to Get Your Saves" for help in obtaining your save files.

    - In your game, clear out boxes 1 and 2 by moving the Pokémon to other boxes.
        - The boxes don't need to be named "Box 1" and "Box 2", nor do they even need to be the original "Box 1" and "Box 2". They just need to be the first two boxes in your game.
    - If you can, clear out ALL boxes that you plan to view in the program. It is optional, but decryption seems to work a little better if ALL boxes (that you plan to use) are cleared out at this point.
    - Place six (6) Pokémon that you've caught or hatched into the first row of the first box. They MUST come from your game (either caught or hatched).
    - Save your game, soft reset (push Select + L + R), reload your game, and save again.
    - Exit the game and copy your save to your PC.
    - Rename this save "16.sav" or "16.bin" depending on its original extension
        - If your file does not have an extension, just rename it "16"
    - Open your game and move the 6 Pokémon from the top row of Box 1 to the top row of Box 2.
    - Save ONCE.
    - Exit the game and copy your save to your PC.
    - Rename this save "165.sav" or "165.bin" depending on its original extension.
        - If your file does not have an extension, just rename it "165"
    - Open your game and save once. Do not do anything else.
    - Exit the game and copy your save to your PC.
    - Rename this save "26.sav" or "26.bin" depending on its original extension.
        - If your file does not have an extension, just rename it "26"
    - In the program, go to the "Options" tab and load your three saves into the lower section.
        - File 1: 26
        - File 2: 16
        - File 3: 165
    - Click "Break"
    - Save your key file in the suggested directory.
        - You can name the file whatever you want, but do not change the save directory.
        
You can now go to the "SAV" tab to open any save from this game!

Breaking the Encryption for More Boxes
--------------------------------------

After you initially broke the encryption, you can dump any box. However, much of the data will be "Unsure", which can either be marked with ~ or hidden (according to your selections in the Options tab).

In order for your encryption to be completely broken, the program must see three different states for each slot. A slot is a spot in a box that can either be empty or filled with a Pokémon. So, you have 30 slots in each box, and 930 slots total (30 slots times 31 boxes). For each slot to be fully decrypted, you must open different saves such that each slot is empty, filled with a Pokémon, and filled with a different Pokémon (the three states).

The easiest way to do this is by doing the following:

    - Empty all boxes (or just the ones that you want fully decrypted if you're unable to empty all your boxes).
    - Create a backup to your PC.
    - Fill all boxes with Pokémon.
    - Create a backup to your PC.
    - In the game, tap the button in the lower-left corner, then move each box over by one.
        - The easiest way to do this is to drag Box 1 to the Box 31 spot (so they swap), then drag Box 31 one-by-one to the spot before the spot that Box 1 is in.
        - You should now have Box 2 as your first box, and Box 1 as your last box.
    - Create a backup to your PC.
    - In the Options tab of the program, in the very bottom section, click the "Folder" button, select the folder where you stored the backups you just created, then click "Break".
    
To verify complete decryption, open one of your "full" saves in the "SAV" tab. You should see all 930 Pokémon with no "Unsure" data (or fewer if you created backups with not all boxes empty).
