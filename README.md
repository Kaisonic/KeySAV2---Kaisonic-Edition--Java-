KeySAV2 - Kaisonic Edition
=============================================

Nintendo 3DS Pokémon X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire Save File and Battle Video Decryption Program

KeySAV2 is a tool that can decrypt portions of encrypted Generation 6 Pokémon saves, including X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire. If you follow the setup guide correctly, you'll be able to view IVs, nature, shiny values, and more of all the hatched and unhatched Pokémon in your boxes or battle videos.

Both retail cartridges and digital copies are supported!

If you have a digital copy, you only need an SD card reader to extract your encrypted save.

If you have a retail copy, you need additional hardware to extract your encrypted save from your cartridge, such as the Datel Action Replay PowerSaves 3DS.

Other encrypted and decrypted saves are supported too, including CyberGadget, YABD, PCEdit, and RAM2Sav.
