========================================
Version 2.0 (2015-07-22)
- 

Version 1.3.8 (2015-01-29)

- Added "Has Hidden Ability" column
- Added "Has Hidden Ability" filter
- Changed "Row,Col" back to "Slot" for all output except CSV output

- Fixed unhandled exception when decrypting certain Pokemon moves failed

Version 1.3.7 (2015-01-05)

- Added support for CyberGadget backups
- Merged filter updates from Cu3PO42's version
- Filter options are only visible when filter is enabled
- Added ball image column for the SVExchange subreddit

Version 1.3.6 (2014-12-14)
- CSV output file name now defaults to name of the SAV or BV you've opened
- Fixed: IV counter shows "1 IVs"
- Fixed: hatched date for eggs is "2000-00-00"
- Added: "Steps to Hatch" column for eggs
- Added: "Reset to Default" button for CSV custom output

Version 1.3.5 (2014-12-07)
- Added columns: OT gender, met level, OT friendship, OT affection
- Fixed newlines and file paths for better compatibility

Version 1.3.4 (2014-12-07)
- Fixed "Backup SAV" button size
- Fixed empty first line in text output if "Split Boxes" was checked
- Added more descriptive headers ("All Boxes", "Boxes 1-4", etc)
- Fixed shiny star appearing for eggs (it is now a checkmark, like it should be)
- Fixed Unown forms (will now show as "Unown-A", "Unown-D", "Unown-!", etc)
- Added a column for number in the dump (just goes from 1 to number of Pokémon dumped)
- Added Pokerus status columns (Infected and Cured)
- Re-ordered default CSV custom columns to make a little more sense
    - To reset your CSV custom format, erase the format from the text box, switch to another format, then switch back to CSV custom and the default will be filled in
    - This default is just a specific order of ALL available columns
    - This does NOT effect the "CSV default" option, so any program that parses the standard CSV output from this program will still work!

- Updated guide so the breaking process is easier to follow
