How to Get Your Saves

If you have a 3DS or 3DS XL (not the new 3DS) running firmware version between 9.0 and 9.5.0-22 (you can check this in your System Options), then the best method to get your saves is the web injection exploit method. You'll need Cu3PO42's tool called YABD (https://www.reddit.com/r/SVExchange/wiki/yabd). See "How to Open Decrypted Saves" for how to open those files.

If you have a digital copy, you can copy your saves directly from your SD card. Go into your SD card, then into the "Nintendo 3DS" directory, then the directory with a bunch of letters and numbers, then another directory with a bunch of letters and numbers, then:

    For X, your save is \title\00040000\00055d00\content\data\00000001.sav
    For Y, your save is \title\00040000\00055e00\content\data\00000001.sav
    For OR, your save is \title\00040000\0011c400\content\data\00000001.sav
    For AS, your save is \title\00040000\0011c500\content\data\00000001.sav

You can open these directly in this program. If you click "Open Save" with your SD card inserted in your computer, the program should automatically navigate to your save's location, as long as you've selected the correct "Game" in the upper-right corner. If not, just navigate to the path above to find your save.

If you want to backup your save to your computer, you can do so with the "Backup Save" button after you've opened it. Make sure to do this before renaming the backup copy. NEVER edit or rename these files directly on your SD card!

If you have a retail copy, you must use a Datel Action Replay PowerSaves device and its included software to obtain your save. The save files are stored in C:\Users\YourName\Powersaves3DS.
