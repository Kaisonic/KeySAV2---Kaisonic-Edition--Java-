How to Get Your Saves

If you have a 3DS or 3DS XL (not the new 3DS) running firmware version 9.x (up to 9.5 - you can check this in your System Options), then the best method to get your saves is the web injection exploit method. You'll need Cu3PO42's tool called YABD (https://www.reddit.com/r/SVExchange/wiki/yabd). See "How to Open Decrypted Saves" for how to open those files.

If you have a digital copy, you can copy your saves directly from your SD card. Go into your SD card, then into the "Nintendo 3DS" directory, then the directory with a bunch of letters and numbers, then another directory with a bunch of letters and numbers, then:

    For X, your save is \title\00040000\00055d00\content\data\00000001.sav
    For Y, your save is \title\00040000\00055e00\content\data\00000001.sav
    For OR, your save is \title\00040000\0011c400\content\data\00000001.sav
    For AS, your save is \title\00040000\0011c500\content\data\00000001.sav
    
Make sure to copy the file to your PC before renaming it or doing anything else with it. NEVER edit these files on your SD card!

If you have a retail copy, you must use a Datel Action Replay PowerSaves device and its included software to obtain your save. The save files are stored in C:\Users\YourName\Powersaves3DS.
