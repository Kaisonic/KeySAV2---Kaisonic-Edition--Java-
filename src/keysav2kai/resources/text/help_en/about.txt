KeySAV3 (This version maintained by Kaisonic)
=============================================

3DS X/Y/OR/AS SaveFile Box / Battle Video PKX cracking program.

KeySAV is a tool that can decrypt portions of encrypted Generation 6 Pokémon saves, including X, Y, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire.

With this tool you can view IVs/Nature/ESV/TSV and much more of Hatched/Unhatched Pokémon that are in your boxes or battle videos, as long as you follow the setup guide properly.

SUPPORTS BOTH RETAIL CARTRIDGES AND DIGITAL COPIES

If you have a digital copy, you only need an SD card reader to extract your encrypted save.

If you have a retail copy, you need additional hardware to extract your encrypted save from your cartridge, such as the Datel Action Replay PowerSaves 3DS.

CyberGadget encrypted save backups are also supported.

New in KeySAV3 - You can now open decrypted saves too! This program now supports YABD, PCEdit, and RAM2Sav files created using the web injection exploit!
