How to Open Encrypted Saves

- Go to the "SAV" tab of the program.
- Click on "Open SAV"
    - If you have a digital copy and your SD card is inserted, the program should automatically load your save for you.
    - Otherwise, select your file.
- If you have not yet generated a key file for your selected save, the program will tell you and it will not let you proceed.
- Select the boxes you would like to show, or leave "All" selected.
- Go the "Options" tab to make your selections on Export Style and various other options.
- Click "Enable" under "Filtering" in the "SAV" tab to do any filtering that you would like.
- Click "Go".
- Your Pokémon information should appear!

If no Pokémon appear, it's likely that your Filter or Box settings are incorrect.

If some Pokémon do not appear that you KNOW should be there, or if Pokémon appear in slots you know to be empty, it's likely that decryption somehow failed. This is a known bug. To try and fix this, it's suggested to re-create your break saves and break your encryption again (re-create your key file). If you followed the "Breaking Additional Slots" instructions, it's suggested to open your "empty" save first after re-breaking, then open your two "full" saves.
