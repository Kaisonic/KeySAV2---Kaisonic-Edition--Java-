How to Get Your Battle Videos

Battle videos are stored on the SD card for both retail copies and digital copies. Keep in mind that Battle Videos might not be sorted chronologically, so check the files' modification dates to make sure you pick the correct one.

Go into your SD card, then into the "Nintendo 3DS" directory, then the directory with a bunch of letters and numbers, then another directory with a bunch of letters and numbers, then:

    For X, your battle videos are in \extdata\00000000\0000055d\00000000\
    For Y, your battle videos are in \extdata\00000000\0000055e\00000000\
    For OR, your battle videos are in \extdata\00000000\0011c400\00000000\
    For AS, your battle videos are in \extdata\00000000\0011c500\00000000\
    
You can open these directly in this program. Click "Open Video" and navigate to the path above on your SD card.

If you want to backup your video to your computer, you can do so with the "Backup BV" button after you've opened it.

To prepare for the next time you create a battle video, delete the video you've just opened from your SD card in order to make sure that your game saves the new video in the same slot.
