How to Get Your Battle Videos

Battle videos are stored on the SD card for both retail copies and digital copies. Keep in mind that Battle Videos might not be sorted chronologically, so check the files' modification dates to make sure you pick the correct one.

Go into your SD card, then into the "Nintendo 3DS" directory, then the directory with a bunch of letters and numbers, then another directory with a bunch of letters and numbers, then:

    For X, your battle videos are in \extdata\00000000\0000055d\00000000\
    For Y, your battle videos are in \extdata\00000000\0000055e\00000000\
    For OR, your battle videos are in \extdata\00000000\000011c4\00000000\
    For AS, your battle videos are in \extdata\00000000\000011c5\00000000\
    
Make sure to copy the file to your PC before renaming it or doing anything else with it. NEVER edit these files on your SD card!
