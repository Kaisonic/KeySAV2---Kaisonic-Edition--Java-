How to Use KeySAV2 - Kaisonic Edition

This program is for dumping various information about Pokémon from various files. There are two types of save game backups: encrypted and decrypted. The following encrypted files are supported:

- Digital copy saved games
- Datel Action Replay PowerSaves backups
- CyberGadget backups

This program will break the encryption of those files - see "How to Break Save Encryption".

The following decrypted files are supported:

- YABD boxes.bin files (https://www.reddit.com/r/SVExchange/wiki/yabd)
- PCEdit pcdata.bin files (http://projectpokemon.org/forums/showthread.php?44561-PCEdit-Full-PC-Dumping-and-Injection-for-X-Y-OR-AS)
- RAM2Sav ramsav.bin files (http://projectpokemon.org/forums/showthread.php?44618-RAM2Sav-Save-File-Dumping-Injection-for-X-Y-OR-AS)

Those files are created using a web injection exploit; more information on how to obtain those files can be read in their respective threads. To use these types of files, simply open them in the SAV tab - no breaking is necessary.

NOTE: RAM2Sav support is in beta. If the program can't open your ramsav.bin for some reason, it's suggested to use PCEdit instead.

For users that are unable to obtain a file of any of the types above, this program also supports Battle Videos - see "How to Break Battle Video Encryption" and "How to Open Battle Videos".

Once you have your file, whether it be an encrypted save, a decrypted save, or a Battle Video, you can then use this program to view all sorts of data about your Pokémon! See "Export Options" for more information.
